# PINF-wolf-sheep-cabbage
Pascal program that solves wolf sheep cabbage riddle, for Computer Science Basics class at Computer Science course at Department of Electricity at Warsaw University of Technology

## Compiling
Compiled with [FPC](https://www.freepascal.org/).

Uses Crt unit, that for some reason only works on UNIX based OS'es, at least for me (on Windows it compiles fine, but there is no output during execution).

## Options
- d \<byte\> : sets depth of search
- h {true, false} : if true, doesn't display failed movesets
